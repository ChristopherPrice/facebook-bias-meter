To build, simply run the following commands:
    
* `npm install`

* `npm run build`

This will install all dev dependencies, transpile and bundle JS, and install front-end dependencies.

Similarly, once dev dependencies are installed you can run the following command:
    
* `npm run watch`

This will run the build script on file changes.

To clear all build artifacts, run the following command:
    
* `npm run clean`
